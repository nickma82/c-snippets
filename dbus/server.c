 * In more complicated code, the GObject definition, implementation
 * and D-Bus registration would all live in separate files. In this
 * server, they're all present in this file.
 *
 * This program will pull the automatically generated D-Bus/GLib stub
 * code (which contains the marshaling code as well as a binding/call
 * table.
 *
 * This program also might serve as an introduction into implementing
 * custom GType/GObjects, but it is not the primary purpose here.
 * Important things like object life-time management (freeing of
 * objects), sub-classing and GObject properties are not covered at
 * all.
 *
 * Demonstrates a simple implementation of "tracing" as well (via the
 * NO_DAEMON define, as when built as non-daemonizing version, will
 * output information about what is happening and where. Adding
 * timestamps to each trace message is left out (see gettimeofday()
 * system call for a simple solution).
